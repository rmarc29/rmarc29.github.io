        In order to enhance my skills in version control and collaborative software development, I undertook the GitHub Foundations course on Microsoft Learn. This training provided me with a comprehensive understanding of GitHub's core features and best practices for using Git in a team environment.
    
        The course covers essential topics such as repository management, branching strategies, pull requests, and issue tracking. By completing this training, I have gained the ability to effectively manage codebases, collaborate with other developers, and contribute to open-source projects.
