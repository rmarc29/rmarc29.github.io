      In March 2025, I had the opportunity to attend the Explore Careers Fair in Dijon, France. This event was organized by the city of Dijon to connect students and job seekers with local businesses and organizations.

      The fair provided a platform for networking, learning about various career paths, and exploring job opportunities in the Dijon area and all surrounding regions. It featured booths from a wide range of industries, including technology, healthcare, finance, and more.

      Here is a picture of our Cybersecurity teacher who was in charge of the booth representing our Networks & Telecoms department at the university of Marie & Louis Pasteur.

      During the event, I was a part of the <span class="cybersecurity-word">cybersecurity</span> booth, where I represented my university's Networks & Telecoms department. The booth aimed to raise awareness about <span class="cybersecurity-word">cybersecurity</span> careers and the importance of <span class="cybersecurity-word">cybersecurity</span> in today's digital world.

      I engaged with attendees by discussing various <span class="cybersecurity-word">cybersecurity</span> topics, sharing insights about the field, and providing information about the educational programs offered by my university. I also highlighted the skills and knowledge required for a successful career in <span class="cybersecurity-word">cybersecurity</span>.

      All of the above was done while training on CTF exercises exclusively created for this event (easy to medium), giving attendees practical, hands-on exposure.
