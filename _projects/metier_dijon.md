      On March 19 and 20, 2025, I had the opportunity to participate in "Explore les métiers" (Explore Careers), a regional forum organized by the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region at the Dijon Exhibition Park. This event was open to the public: middle school students, high school students, university students, apprentices, job seekers, parents, and everyone curious about careers.

      "Explore les métiers" offers a unique experience by transporting visitors into the professional worlds that surround everyday life. The forum featured approximately 60 professions grouped into thematic sectors: Food, Automotive and Engines, Building and Civil Works, Agriculture, Industry, Services, Communication and Digital, Healthcare, Armed Forces, and Agriculture. More than 400 young competitors showcased these different professions, providing a playful and active learning experience.

      Visitors could learn professional skills, exchange with passionate experts, learn about educational programs, and take on practical challenges.

      Here is a picture of our Cybersecurity teacher who was in charge of the booth representing our Networks & Telecoms department Cybersecurity program at the university of Marie & Louis Pasteur.

      During the event, I was a part of the <span class="cybersecurity-word">cybersecurity</span> booth, where I represented my university's Networks & Telecoms department. The booth aimed to raise awareness about <span class="cybersecurity-word">cybersecurity</span> careers and the importance of <span class="cybersecurity-word">cybersecurity</span> in today's digital world.

      I engaged with attendees by discussing various <span class="cybersecurity-word">cybersecurity</span> topics, sharing insights about the field, and providing information about the educational programs offered by my university. I also highlighted the skills and knowledge required for a successful career in <span class="cybersecurity-word">cybersecurity</span>.

      All of the above was done while training on CTF exercises exclusively created for this event (easy to medium), giving attendees practical, hands-on exposure.
