      EZcape is a C# tool designed to help Escape from Tarkov players keep track of their ongoing tasks, and progress efficiently. 
      
      It has a light and dark theme for a better UX. I created this tool to learn about API's and how to use them. 
      
      This app is using tarkov.dev's API for quests informations and rewards.

    text: "I have learned, while creating this app, about versioning and how to prompt the user to update his app to the newest realease version. To do this, I created a gist (a way to share code snippets, notes, and other small pieces of information). The app will read on launch the gist, that will give it the current version. "
