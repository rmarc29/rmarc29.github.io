      EZcape is a C# tool designed to help Escape from Tarkov players keep track of their ongoing tasks, and progress efficiently. It has a light and dark theme for a better UX.

      I created this tool to learn more about C# developement and about API's and how to use them. 
      This app is using <a href="https://tarkov.dev" style="color:#4FC3F7;">tarkov.dev</a>'s API for quests informations and rewards.

  - title: "Versioning"
    text: |
     I have learned, while creating this app, about versioning and how to prompt the user to update his app to the newest realease version.

     To do this, I created a gist (a way to share code snippets, notes, and other small pieces of information). The app will read on launch the gist, this will give the app the current version.
