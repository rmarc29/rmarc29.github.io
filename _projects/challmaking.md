  - title: "Versioning"
    text: |
     I have learned, while creating this app, about versioning and how to prompt the user to update his app to the newest realease version.

     To do this, I created a gist (a way to share code snippets, notes, and other small pieces of information). The app will read on launch the gist, this will give the app the current version.
